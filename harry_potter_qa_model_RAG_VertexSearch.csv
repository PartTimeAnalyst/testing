One day when he was out walking, he came to
an open place in the middle of the forest, and in the
middle of this place was a large oak-tree, and, from
the top of the tree, there came a loud buzzing-noise.

downstairs now, bump, bump, bump, on the back
of his head, behind Christopher Robin. It is, as far
as he knows, the only way of coming downstairs,
but sometimes he feels that there really is another

When I first heard his name, I said, just as you

""So did I,"" said Christopher Robin.
""Then you can't call him Winnie?""
""I don't.""

HERE is Edward Bear, coming
downstairs now, bump, bump, bump, on the back
of his head, behind Christopher Robin. It is, as far
as he knows, the only way of coming downstairs,
but sometimes he feels that there really is another
way, if only he could stop bumping for a moment
and think of it. And then he feels that perhaps there
isn't. Anyhow, here he is at the bottom, and ready
to be introduced to you. Winnie-the-Pooh.
When I first heard his name, I said, just as you

downstairs now, bump, bump, bump, on the back
of his head, behind Christopher Robin. It is, as far
as he knows, the only way of coming downstairs,

isn't. Anyhow, here he is at the bottom, and ready

downstairs now, bump, bump, bump, on the back
of his head, behind Christopher Robin. It is, as far

to be introduced to you. Winnie-the-Pooh.
When I first heard his name, I said, just as you

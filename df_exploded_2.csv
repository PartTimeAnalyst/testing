THE BOY WHO LIVED
M r. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say
that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people
you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just
didn’t hold with such nonsense.
Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made
drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a
very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the
usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her
time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a
small
son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and
their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they
could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs.
Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley
pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing
husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered
to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The
Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even
seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they
didn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.
When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story
starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and
mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley
hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley
gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.
None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.
At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.
Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because
Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.
“Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car
and backed out of number four’s drive.

small
son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.

their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they

pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing

M r. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say
that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people
you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just
didn’t hold with such nonsense.
Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made
drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a
very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the
usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her
time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a
small
son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and
their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they
could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs.
Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley
pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing
husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered
to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The
Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even
seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they
didn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.
When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story
starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and
mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley
hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley
gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.
None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.
At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.
Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because
Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.
“Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car

1,"something peculiar — a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t
realize what he had seen — then he jerked his head around to look again. There
was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in
sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the
light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley
drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was
now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats
couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the
cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a
large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.
But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something
else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that
there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr.
Dursley couldn’t bear people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups you
saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He
drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these
weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr.
Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that
man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The
nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly
stunt —these people were obviously collecting for something…yes, that would
be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the
Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.
Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the
ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills
that morning. He didn’t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though
people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after
owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr.
Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five
different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit
more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch
his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.
He’d for gotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of
them next to the baker’s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn’t know
why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and
he couldn’t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them,
clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they
were saying.

drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was
now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats
couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the
cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a
large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.
But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something
else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that
there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr.
Dursley couldn’t bear people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups you
saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He
drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these
weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr.
Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that
man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The
nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly
stunt —these people were obviously collecting for something…yes, that would
be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the
Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.
Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the
ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills
that morning. He didn’t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though
people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after
owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr.
Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five
different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit
more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch
his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.
He’d for gotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of
them next to the baker’s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn’t know
why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and
he couldn’t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them,
clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they
were saying.

realize what he had seen — then he jerked his head around to look again. There
was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in

be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the
Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.
Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the
ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills
that morning. He didn’t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though
people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after
owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr.
Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five
different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit
more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch
his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.
He’d for gotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of
them next to the baker’s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn’t know
why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and
he couldn’t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them,
clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they
were saying.
“The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard —”

realize what he had seen — then he jerked his head around to look again. There
was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in
sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the
light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley
drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was
now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats
couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the
cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a
large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.
But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something
else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that
there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr.
Dursley couldn’t bear people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups you
saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He
drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these
weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr.
Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that
man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The
nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly

",2,"something peculiar — a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t
realize what he had seen — then he jerked his head around to look again. There
was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in
sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the
light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley
drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was
now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats
couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the
cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a
large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.
But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something
else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that
there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr.
Dursley couldn’t bear people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups you
saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He
drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these
weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr.
Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that
man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The
nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly
stunt —these people were obviously collecting for something…yes, that would
be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the
Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.
Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the
ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills
that morning. He didn’t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though
people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after
owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr.
Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five
different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit
more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch
his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.
He’d for gotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of
them next to the baker’s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn’t know
why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and
he couldn’t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them,
clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they
were saying.

Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that
man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The
nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly
stunt —these people were obviously collecting for something…yes, that would
be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the
Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.
Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the
ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills
that morning. He didn’t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though
people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after
owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr.
Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five
different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit
more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch
his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.
He’d for gotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of
them next to the baker’s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn’t know
why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and
he couldn’t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them,
clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they
were saying.

realize what he had seen — then he jerked his head around to look again. There
was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in
sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the
light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley
drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was
now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats
couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the
cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a
large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.
But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something
else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that
there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr.

realize what he had seen — then he jerked his head around to look again. There
was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in
sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the
light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley
drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was
now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats
couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the
cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a
large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.
But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something
else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that
there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr.
Dursley couldn’t bear people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups you
saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He
drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these
weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr.
Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that
man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The
nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly
stunt —these people were obviously collecting for something…yes, that would
be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the
Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.
Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the
ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills
that morning. He didn’t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though
people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after
owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr.
Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five
different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit
more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch
his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.

But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something
else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that
there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr.
Dursley couldn’t bear people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups you
saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He
drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these
weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr.
Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that
man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The
nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly
stunt —these people were obviously collecting for something…yes, that would
be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the
Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.
Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the
ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills
that morning. He didn’t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though
people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after
owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr.
Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five
different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit
more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch
his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.
He’d for gotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of
them next to the baker’s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn’t know
why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and
he couldn’t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them,
clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they
were saying.

",2,"something peculiar — a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t
realize what he had seen — then he jerked his head around to look again. There
was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in
sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the
light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley
drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was
now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats
couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the
cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a

Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the
whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.
He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his
secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished
dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back
down and stroked his mustache, thinking…no, he was being stupid. Potter
wasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter
who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew
was called Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or
Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at
any
mention of her sister. He didn’t blame her — if he’d had a sister like that…
but all the same, those people in cloaks.…
He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when
he left the building at five o’clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight
into someone just outside the door.
“Sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was
a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet
cloak. He didn’t seem at all
upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the
contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made
passersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today!
Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself
should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!”
And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.
Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete
stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He
was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining
things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn’t approve of
imagination.
As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw —
and it didn’t improve his mood — was the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning. It
was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the
same markings around its eyes.
“Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly.
The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat

whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.
He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his
secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished
dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back
down and stroked his mustache, thinking…no, he was being stupid. Potter
wasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter
who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew
was called Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or
Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at
any
mention of her sister. He didn’t blame her — if he’d had a sister like that…
but all the same, those people in cloaks.…
He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when
he left the building at five o’clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight
into someone just outside the door.
“Sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was
a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet
cloak. He didn’t seem at all
upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the
contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made
passersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today!
Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself
should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!”
And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.
Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete
stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He
was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining
things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn’t approve of
imagination.
As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw —
and it didn’t improve his mood — was the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning. It
was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the
same markings around its eyes.
“Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly.
The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat
behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself
into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.

Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the
whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.
He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his
secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished
dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back
down and stroked his mustache, thinking…no, he was being stupid. Potter
wasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter
who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew
was called Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or
Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at
any
mention of her sister. He didn’t blame her — if he’d had a sister like that…
but all the same, those people in cloaks.…
He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when
he left the building at five o’clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight
into someone just outside the door.
“Sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was
a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet
cloak. He didn’t seem at all
upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the
contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made
passersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today!
Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself
should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!”
And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.
Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete
stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He
was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining
things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn’t approve of
imagination.
As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw —
and it didn’t improve his mood — was the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning. It
was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the
same markings around its eyes.
“Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly.
The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat
behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself
into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.

Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the
whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.
He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his
secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished
dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back
down and stroked his mustache, thinking…no, he was being stupid. Potter
wasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter
who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew
was called Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or
Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at
any
mention of her sister. He didn’t blame her — if he’d had a sister like that…
but all the same, those people in cloaks.…
He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when
he left the building at five o’clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight
into someone just outside the door.
“Sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was
a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet
cloak. He didn’t seem at all
upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the
contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made
passersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today!
Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself
should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!”
And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.
Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete
stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He
was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining
things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn’t approve of
imagination.
As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw —
and it didn’t improve his mood — was the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning. It
was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the
same markings around its eyes.
“Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly.

Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the
whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.
He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his
secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished
dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back
down and stroked his mustache, thinking…no, he was being stupid. Potter
wasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter
who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew
was called Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or
Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at
any
mention of her sister. He didn’t blame her — if he’d had a sister like that…
but all the same, those people in cloaks.…
He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when
he left the building at five o’clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight
into someone just outside the door.
“Sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was
a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet
cloak. He didn’t seem at all
upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the
contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made
passersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today!
Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself
should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!”
And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.
Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete
stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He
was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining
things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn’t approve of
imagination.
As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw —
and it didn’t improve his mood — was the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning. It
was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the

was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the
same markings around its eyes.
“Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly.
The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat
behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself
into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.

Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the
whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.
He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his
secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished
dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back
down and stroked his mustache, thinking…no, he was being stupid. Potter
wasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter
who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew
was called Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or
Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at
any
mention of her sister. He didn’t blame her — if he’d had a sister like that…
but all the same, those people in cloaks.…
He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when
he left the building at five o’clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight
into someone just outside the door.
“Sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was
a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet
cloak. He didn’t seem at all
upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the
contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made
passersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today!
Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself
should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!”
And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.
Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete
stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He
was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining
things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn’t approve of
imagination.

had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report
on the evening news:
“And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation’s
owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at
night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings
of these birds flying in every
direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to
explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.” The
newscaster allowed himself a grin. “Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim
McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight,
Jim?”
“Well, Ted,” said the weatherman, “I don’t know about that, but it’s not
only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent,
Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I
promised yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people
have been celebrating Bonfire Night early — it’s not until next week, folks! But
I can promise a wet night tonight.”
Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain?
Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a
whisper, a whisper about the Potters.…
Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was
no good. He’d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. “Er

As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all,
they normally pretended she didn’t have a sister.
“No,” she said sharply. “Why?”
“Funny stuff on the news,” Mr. Dursley mumbled. “Owls…shooting
stars…and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today.…”
“So?” snapped Mrs. Dursley.
“Well, I just thought…maybe…it was something to do with…you
know…her crowd.”
Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered
whether he dared tell her he’d heard the name “Potter.” He decided he didn’t
dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, “Their son — he’d be about
Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?”
“I suppose so,” said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.

had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report
on the evening news:
“And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation’s
owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at
night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings
of these birds flying in every
direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to
explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.” The
newscaster allowed himself a grin. “Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim
McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight,
Jim?”
“Well, Ted,” said the weatherman, “I don’t know about that, but it’s not
only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent,
Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I
promised yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people
have been celebrating Bonfire Night early — it’s not until next week, folks! But
I can promise a wet night tonight.”
Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain?
Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a
whisper, a whisper about the Potters.…
Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was
no good. He’d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. “Er

As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all,
they normally pretended she didn’t have a sister.
“No,” she said sharply. “Why?”
“Funny stuff on the news,” Mr. Dursley mumbled. “Owls…shooting
stars…and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today.…”

Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought
before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no
reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well
what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind....He couldn’t see how he
and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on — he
yawned and turned over — it couldn’t affect them.…
How very wrong he was.
Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on
the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a
statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so
much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls
swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.
A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so
suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d just popped out of the ground.
The cat’s tail twitched and its eyes
narrowed.
Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall,
thin, and
very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both
long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that
swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light,
bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long
and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man’s name was
Albus Dumbledore.
Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a
street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was
busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize
he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still
staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the
cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have known.”

The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr.
Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought
before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no
reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well
what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind....He couldn’t see how he
and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on — he
yawned and turned over — it couldn’t affect them.…
How very wrong he was.
Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on
the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a
statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so
much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls
swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.
A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so
suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d just popped out of the ground.
The cat’s tail twitched and its eyes
narrowed.
Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall,
thin, and
very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both
long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that
swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light,
bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long
and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man’s name was
Albus Dumbledore.
Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a
street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was
busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize
he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still
staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the
cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have known.”
He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a
silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The

Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought

Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on
the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a
statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so
much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls
swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.
A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so
suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d just popped out of the ground.
The cat’s tail twitched and its eyes
narrowed.
Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall,
thin, and
very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both
long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that
swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light,
bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long
and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man’s name was
Albus Dumbledore.
Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a
street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was
busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize
he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still
staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the
cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have known.”

Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought
before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no
reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well
what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind....He couldn’t see how he
and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on — he
yawned and turned over — it couldn’t affect them.…
How very wrong he was.
Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on
the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a
statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so
much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls
swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.
A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so
suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d just popped out of the ground.
The cat’s tail twitched and its eyes
narrowed.
Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall,
thin, and
very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both
long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that
swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light,
bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long
and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man’s name was
Albus Dumbledore.
Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a
street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was
busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize
he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still
staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the
cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have known.”
He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a

Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on
the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a
statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so
much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls
swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.
A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so
suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d just popped out of the ground.
The cat’s tail twitched and its eyes
narrowed.
Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall,
thin, and
very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both
long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that
swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light,
bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long
and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man’s name was
Albus Dumbledore.
Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a
street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was
busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize
he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still
staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the
cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have known.”
He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a
silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The

How very wrong he was.
Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on
the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a
statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so
much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls
swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.
A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so
suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d just popped out of the ground.
The cat’s tail twitched and its eyes
narrowed.
Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall,
thin, and
very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both
long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that
swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light,
bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long
and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man’s name was
Albus Dumbledore.
Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a
street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was
busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize
he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still
staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the
cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have known.”
He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a
silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The

He didn’t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed.
While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom
window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was
staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.
Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the
Potters? If it did...if it got out that they were related to a pair of — well, he didn’t
think he could bear it.
The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr.
Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought
before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no
reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well
what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind....He couldn’t see how he

were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window
now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn’t be able to see anything that
was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back
inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat
down on the wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after a moment he
spoke to it.
“Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.”
He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at
a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the
shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a
cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked
distinctly ruffled.
“How did you know it was me?” she asked.
“My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.”
“You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,” said
Professor McGonagall.
“All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a
dozen feasts and parties on my way here.”
Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.
“Oh yes, I’ve celebrating, all right,” she said impatiently. “You’d think
they’d be a bit more careful, but no —even the Muggles have noticed
something’s going on. It was on their news.” She jerked her head back at the
Dursleys’ dark living-room window. “I heard it. Flocks of owls…shooting
stars…Well, they’re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice
something. Shooting stars down in Kent — I’ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He
never had much sense.”
“You can’t blame them,” said Dumbledore gently. “We’ve had precious
little to celebrate for eleven years.”
“I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably. “But that’s no reason
to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in
broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.”
She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though
hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn’t, so she went on. “A fine
thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared
at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone,

inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat
down on the wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after a moment he
spoke to it.
“Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.”
He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at
a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the
shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a
cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked
distinctly ruffled.
“How did you know it was me?” she asked.
“My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.”
“You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,” said
Professor McGonagall.
“All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a
dozen feasts and parties on my way here.”
Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.
“Oh yes, I’ve celebrating, all right,” she said impatiently. “You’d think
they’d be a bit more careful, but no —even the Muggles have noticed
something’s going on. It was on their news.” She jerked her head back at the
Dursleys’ dark living-room window. “I heard it. Flocks of owls…shooting
stars…Well, they’re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice
something. Shooting stars down in Kent — I’ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He
never had much sense.”
“You can’t blame them,” said Dumbledore gently. “We’ve had precious
little to celebrate for eleven years.”
“I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably. “But that’s no reason
to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in
broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.”
She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though
hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn’t, so she went on. “A fine
thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared
at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone,
Dumbledore?”

down on the wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after a moment he
spoke to it.
“Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.”
He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at
a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the
shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a
cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked
distinctly ruffled.
“How did you know it was me?” she asked.
“My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.”
“You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,” said
Professor McGonagall.
“All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a
dozen feasts and parties on my way here.”
Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.
“Oh yes, I’ve celebrating, all right,” she said impatiently. “You’d think
they’d be a bit more careful, but no —even the Muggles have noticed
something’s going on. It was on their news.” She jerked her head back at the
Dursleys’ dark living-room window. “I heard it. Flocks of owls…shooting
stars…Well, they’re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice
something. Shooting stars down in Kent — I’ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He
never had much sense.”
“You can’t blame them,” said Dumbledore gently. “We’ve had precious
little to celebrate for eleven years.”
“I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably. “But that’s no reason
to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in
broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.”
She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though
hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn’t, so she went on. “A fine
thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared
at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone,
Dumbledore?”

“Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.”
He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at
a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the

cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked
distinctly ruffled.

“My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by

McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops,
seemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we keep saying ‘You-Know-
Who.’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s

exasperated, half admiring. “But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the

never have.”
“Only because you’re too — well — noble to use them.”

told me she liked my new earmuffs.”

“My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by
his name? All this ‘You-Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been
trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.” Professor
McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops,
seemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we keep saying ‘You-Know-
Who.’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s
name.”
“I know you haven’t, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half
exasperated, half admiring. “But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the
only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.”
“You flatter me,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Voldemort had powers I will
never have.”
“Only because you’re too — well — noble to use them.”

told me she liked my new earmuffs.”

anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all

Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her
eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden
watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve
hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It

two people who are less like us. And they’ve got this son — I saw him kicking
his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come
and live here!”
“It’s the best place for him,” said Dumbledore firmly. “His aunt and
uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he’s older. I’ve written
them a letter.”
“A letter?” repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on
the wall. “Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter?
These people will never understand him! He’ll be famous — a legend — I
wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future —
there will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will know
his name!”

half-moon glasses. “It would be enough to turn any boy’s head. Famous before

two people who are less like us. And they’ve got this son — I saw him kicking
his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come
and live here!”
“It’s the best place for him,” said Dumbledore firmly. “His aunt and
uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he’s older. I’ve written
them a letter.”
“A letter?” repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on
the wall. “Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter?
These people will never understand him! He’ll be famous — a legend — I
wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future —
there will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will know
his name!”

hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It

watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve
hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It

Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four.
“Dumbledore — you can’t. I’ve been watching them all day. You couldn’t find

his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come

They’re saying he tried to kill the Potter’s son, Harry. But he couldn’t. He
couldn’t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they’re saying that
when he couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and
that’s why he’s gone.”
Dumbledore nodded glumly.
“It’s — it’s true?” faltered Professor McGonagall. “After all he’s done…
all the people he’s killed…he couldn’t kill a little boy? It’s just astounding…of
all the things to stop him…but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?”
“We can only guess.” said Dumbledore. “We may never know.”
Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her
eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden
watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve
hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It
must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his
pocket and said, “Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be here, by

“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “And I don’t suppose you’re going to
tell me why you’re here, of all places?”

he has left now.”

Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four.

his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come

“It’s the best place for him,” said Dumbledore firmly. “His aunt and

“It’s the best place for him,” said Dumbledore firmly. “His aunt and

them a letter.”

the wall. “Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter?

Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her

watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve
hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It
must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his
pocket and said, “Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be here, by
the way?”
“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “And I don’t suppose you’re going to
tell me why you’re here, of all places?”
“I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They’re the only family
he has left now.”
“You don’t mean – you can’t mean the people who live here?” cried
Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four.

Dumbledore nodded glumly.
“It’s — it’s true?” faltered Professor McGonagall. “After all he’s done…

McGonagall grudgingly, “but you can’t pretend he’s not careless. He does tend

A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew
steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a
headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky — and a huge
motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.
If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it.
He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He
looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild — long tangles of bushy black
hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and
his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms
he was holding a bundle of blankets.
“Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. “At last. And where did
you get that motorcycle?”
“Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said the giant, climbing
carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. “Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I’ve
got him, sir.”
“No problems, were there?”
“No, sir — house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before
the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell asleep as we was flyin’ over
Bristol.”
Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of
blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-
black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut,
like a bolt of
lightning.

“Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said the giant, climbing
carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. “Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I’ve
got him, sir.”
“No problems, were there?”
“No, sir — house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before
the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell asleep as we was flyin’ over
Bristol.”
Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of
blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-
black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut,
like a bolt of
lightning.
“Is that where —?” whispered Professor McGonagall.

“I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,” said Professor
McGonagall grudgingly, “but you can’t pretend he’s not careless. He does tend

A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew
steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a
headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky — and a huge
motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.
If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it.
He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He
looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild — long tangles of bushy black
hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and
his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms
he was holding a bundle of blankets.

If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it.
He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He
looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild — long tangles of bushy black
hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and
his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms
he was holding a bundle of blankets.
“Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. “At last. And where did
you get that motorcycle?”
“Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said the giant, climbing
carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. “Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I’ve
got him, sir.”
“No problems, were there?”
“No, sir — house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before
the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell asleep as we was flyin’ over
Bristol.”
Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of
blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-
black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut,
like a bolt of
lightning.
“Is that where —?” whispered Professor McGonagall.
“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “He’ll have that scar forever.”

here, Dumbledore?” She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might
be hiding Harry underneath it.

A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew

McGonagall grudgingly, “but you can’t pretend he’s not careless. He does tend
to — what was that?”
A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew
steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a
headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky — and a huge
motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.
If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it.
He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He
looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild — long tangles of bushy black
hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and
his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms
he was holding a bundle of blankets.
“Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. “At last. And where did
you get that motorcycle?”
“Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said the giant, climbing
carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. “Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I’ve
got him, sir.”
“No problems, were there?”
“No, sir — house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before
the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell asleep as we was flyin’ over
Bristol.”
Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of
blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-
black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut,
like a bolt of
lightning.
“Is that where —?” whispered Professor McGonagall.
“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “He’ll have that scar forever.”

Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed,

be hiding Harry underneath it.

“You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with something as important as
“I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Dumbledore.
“I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,” said Professor
McGonagall grudgingly, “but you can’t pretend he’s not careless. He does tend
to — what was that?”
A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew
steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a
headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky — and a huge
motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.
If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it.
He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He
looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild — long tangles of bushy black
hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and
his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms
he was holding a bundle of blankets.
“Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. “At last. And where did
you get that motorcycle?”
“Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said the giant, climbing
carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. “Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I’ve
got him, sir.”
“No problems, were there?”
“No, sir — house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before
the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell asleep as we was flyin’ over
Bristol.”
Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of
blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-
black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut,
like a bolt of
lightning.
“Is that where —?” whispered Professor McGonagall.
“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “He’ll have that scar forever.”
“Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?”

Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys’
“Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?” asked Hagrid. He bent his
great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very
scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded
dog.
“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “You’ll wake the Muggles!”
“S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and
burying his face in it. “But I c-c-can’t stand it —Lily an’James dead — an’ poor
little Harry off ter live with Muggles —”
“Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be
found,” Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as
Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He
laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside
Harry’s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the
three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook,
Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually
shone from Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out.
“Well,” said Dumbledore finally, “that’s that. We’ve no business staying
here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.”
“Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, “I’ll be takin’ Sirius his bike
back. G’night, Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.”
Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself
onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the
air and off into the night.
“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,” said
Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.
Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he
stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of
light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange
and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of
the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.
“Good luck, Harry,” he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a
swish of his cloak, he was gone.

Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He
laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside
Harry’s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the
three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook,
Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually
shone from Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out.

Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys’
“Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?” asked Hagrid. He bent his
great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very
scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded
dog.
“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “You’ll wake the Muggles!”
“S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and
burying his face in it. “But I c-c-can’t stand it —Lily an’James dead — an’ poor

here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.”
“Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, “I’ll be takin’ Sirius his bike
back. G’night, Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.”
Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself
onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the
air and off into the night.
“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,” said
Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.
Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he
stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of
light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange
and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of
the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.
“Good luck, Harry,” he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a
swish of his cloak, he was gone.

“Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be
found,” Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as
Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He
laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside
Harry’s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the
three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook,
Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually
shone from Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out.
“Well,” said Dumbledore finally, “that’s that. We’ve no business staying
here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.”
“Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, “I’ll be takin’ Sirius his bike
back. G’night, Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.”
Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself
onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the
air and off into the night.
“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,” said
Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.
Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he
stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of
light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange
and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of
the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.
“Good luck, Harry,” he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a
swish of his cloak, he was gone.

Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys’
“Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?” asked Hagrid. He bent his
great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very
scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded
dog.
“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “You’ll wake the Muggles!”
“S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and
burying his face in it. “But I c-c-can’t stand it —Lily an’James dead — an’ poor

“Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be
found,” Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as
Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He
laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside
Harry’s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the
three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook,
Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually
shone from Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out.
“Well,” said Dumbledore finally, “that’s that. We’ve no business staying
here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.”
“Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, “I’ll be takin’ Sirius his bike
back. G’night, Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.”
Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself
onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the
air and off into the night.
“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,” said
Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.
Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he
stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of
light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange
and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of
the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.
“Good luck, Harry,” he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a
swish of his cloak, he was gone.

Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys’
“Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?” asked Hagrid. He bent his
great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very
scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded
dog.
“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “You’ll wake the Muggles!”
“S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and
burying his face in it. “But I c-c-can’t stand it —Lily an’James dead — an’ poor

N early ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their
nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun
rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the
Dursleys’ front door; it
crept into their living room, which was almost exactly
the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news
report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed
how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of
what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets —

large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a
computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The
room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.
Yet
Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long.
His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise
of the day.
“Up! Get up! Now!”
Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.
“Up!” she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and
then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back
and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one.
There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he’d had the
same dream before.
His aunt was back outside the door.
“Are

“Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don’t you

N early ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their
nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun
rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the
Dursleys’ front door; it
crept into their living room, which was almost exactly
the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news
report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed
how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of
what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets —
but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a
large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a
computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The
room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.
Yet
Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long.
His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise
of the day.
“Up! Get up! Now!”
Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.
“Up!” she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and
then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back
and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one.
There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he’d had the
same dream before.
His aunt was back outside the door.
“Are
you up yet?” she demanded.
“Nearly,” said Harry.
“Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don’t you
dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy’s birthday.”
Harry groaned.

When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table
was almost hidden beneath all Dudley’s birthday presents. It looked as though
Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second
television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a
mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course
it involved punching somebody. Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry, but
he couldn’t often catch him. Harry didn’t look it, but he was very fast.
Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry
had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and
skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of
Dudley’s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin
face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses
held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had
punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance
was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He
had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever
remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.

put together, but it made no difference, his hair
simply grew that way — all over the place.
Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his
mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not
much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on
his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel
— Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.
Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as

“Comb your hair!” he barked, by way of a morning greeting.
About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper
and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than
the rest of the boys in his class
put together, but it made no difference, his hair
simply grew that way — all over the place.
Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his
mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not
much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on
his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel
— Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.
Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as
there wasn’t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His
face fell.

less than last year.”

When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table
was almost hidden beneath all Dudley’s birthday presents. It looked as though
Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second
television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a
mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course
it involved punching somebody. Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry, but
he couldn’t often catch him. Harry didn’t look it, but he was very fast.
Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry
had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and
skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of
Dudley’s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin
face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses
held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had
punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance
was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He
had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever
remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.

“Comb your hair!” he barked, by way of a morning greeting.
About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper
and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than
the rest of the boys in his class
put together, but it made no difference, his hair
simply grew that way — all over the place.
Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his
mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not
much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on
his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel
— Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.
Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as
there wasn’t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His
face fell.

less than last year.”

When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table
was almost hidden beneath all Dudley’s birthday presents. It looked as though
Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second
television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a
mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course
it involved punching somebody. Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry, but
he couldn’t often catch him. Harry didn’t look it, but he was very fast.
Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry
had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and
skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of
Dudley’s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin
face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses
held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had
punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance
was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He
had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever
remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.
“In the car crash when your parents died,” she had said. “And don’t ask
questions.”

“Comb your hair!” he barked, by way of a morning greeting.
About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper
and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than
the rest of the boys in his class
put together, but it made no difference, his hair
simply grew that way — all over the place.
Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his
mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not
much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on
his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel
— Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.
Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as
there wasn’t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His
face fell.

less than last year.”

the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.
When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table
was almost hidden beneath all Dudley’s birthday presents. It looked as though
Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second
television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a
mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course
it involved punching somebody. Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry, but
he couldn’t often catch him. Harry didn’t look it, but he was very fast.
Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry
had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and
skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of
Dudley’s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin
face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses
held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had
punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance
was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He
had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever

About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper
and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than
the rest of the boys in his class

Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his
mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not
much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on
his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel
— Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.
Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as
there wasn’t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His

When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table
was almost hidden beneath all Dudley’s birthday presents. It looked as though
Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second
television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a
mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course
it involved punching somebody. Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry, but
he couldn’t often catch him. Harry didn’t look it, but he was very fast.
Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry
had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and
skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of
Dudley’s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin
face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses

was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from
the telephone looking both angry and worried.
“Bad news, Vernon,” she said. “Mrs. Figg’s broken her leg. She can’t
take him.” She jerked her head in Harry’s direction.
Dudley’s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry’s heart gave a leap. Every
year on Dudley’s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to
adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was
left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry
hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him
look at photographs of all the cats she’d ever owned.

“We could phone Marge,” Uncle Vernon suggested.
“Don’t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.”
The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn’t there

as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.
Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly,
“And we’ll buy you another two presents while we’re out today. How’s that,
popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right”
Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said

hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him

left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry
hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him
look at photographs of all the cats she’d ever owned.
“Now what?” said Aunt

Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though
ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken
her leg, but it wasn’t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year
before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.
“We could phone Marge,” Uncle Vernon suggested.
“Don’t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.”
The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn’t there
— or rather, as though he was something very nasty
that couldn’t understand
them, like a slug.
“What about what’s-her-name, your friend — Yvonne?”

under this big one from Mummy and Daddy.”
“All right, thirty-seven then,” said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry,
who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon
as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.
Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly,
“And we’ll buy you another two presents while we’re out today. How’s that,
popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right”
Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said
slowly, “So I’ll have thirty...thirty...”
then.”
“Thirty-nine, sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia.
“Oh.” Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. “All right
Uncle Vernon chuckled.
“Little tyke wants his money’s worth, just like his father. ’Atta boy,
Dudley!” He ruffled Dudley’s hair.
At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it
while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video
camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He
was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from
the telephone looking both angry and worried.
“Bad news, Vernon,” she said. “Mrs. Figg’s broken her leg. She can’t
take him.” She jerked her head in Harry’s direction.
Dudley’s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry’s heart gave a leap. Every

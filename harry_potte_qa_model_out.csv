HERE is Edward Bear, coming
downstairs now, bump, bump, bump, on the back
of his head, behind Christopher Robin. It is, as far
as he knows, the only way of coming downstairs,
but sometimes he feels that there really is another
way, if only he could stop bumping for a moment
and think of it. And then he feels that perhaps there
isn't. Anyhow, here he is at the bottom, and ready
to be introduced to you. Winnie-the-Pooh.
When I first heard his name, I said, just as you

""So did I,"" said Christopher Robin.
""Then you can't call him Winnie?""

HERE is Edward Bear, coming
downstairs now, bump, bump, bump, on the back
of his head, behind Christopher Robin. It is, as far
as he knows, the only way of coming downstairs,
but sometimes he feels that there really is another
way, if only he could stop bumping for a moment
and think of it. And then he feels that perhaps there
isn't. Anyhow, here he is at the bottom, and ready
to be introduced to you. Winnie-the-Pooh.
When I first heard his name, I said, just as you
are going to say, ""But I thought he was a boy?""
""So did I,"" said Christopher Robin.
""Then you can't call him Winnie?""
""I don't.""
""But you said--""
""He's Winnie-ther-Pooh. Don't you know what

One day when he was out walking, he came to
an open place in the middle of the forest, and in the
middle of this place was a large oak-tree, and, from
the top of the tree, there came a loud buzzing-noise.
Winnie-the-Pooh sat down at the foot of the tree,
put his head between his paws and began to think.

Winnie-the-Pooh and Some
Bees, and the Stories Begin
HERE is Edward Bear, coming
downstairs now, bump, bump, bump, on the back
of his head, behind Christopher Robin. It is, as far
as he knows, the only way of coming downstairs,
but sometimes he feels that there really is another
way, if only he could stop bumping for a moment
and think of it. And then he feels that perhaps there
isn't. Anyhow, here he is at the bottom, and ready
to be introduced to you. Winnie-the-Pooh.
When I first heard his name, I said, just as you
are going to say, ""But I thought he was a boy?""
""So did I,"" said Christopher Robin.
""Then you can't call him Winnie?""
""I don't.""
""But you said--""
""He's Winnie-ther-Pooh. Don't you know what
'ther' means?”

HERE is Edward Bear, coming
downstairs now, bump, bump, bump, on the back
of his head, behind Christopher Robin. It is, as far
as he knows, the only way of coming downstairs,
but sometimes he feels that there really is another
way, if only he could stop bumping for a moment
and think of it. And then he feels that perhaps there
isn't. Anyhow, here he is at the bottom, and ready
to be introduced to you. Winnie-the-Pooh.

Winnie-the-Pooh and Some
Bees, and the Stories Begin
HERE is Edward Bear, coming
downstairs now, bump, bump, bump, on the back
of his head, behind Christopher Robin. It is, as far
as he knows, the only way of coming downstairs,
but sometimes he feels that there really is another
way, if only he could stop bumping for a moment
and think of it. And then he feels that perhaps there
isn't. Anyhow, here he is at the bottom, and ready
to be introduced to you. Winnie-the-Pooh.
When I first heard his name, I said, just as you
are going to say, ""But I thought he was a boy?""
""So did I,"" said Christopher Robin.
""Then you can't call him Winnie?""
""I don't.""
""But you said--""
""He's Winnie-ther-Pooh. Don't you know what
'ther' means?”

Winnie-the-Pooh and Some
Bees, and the Stories Begin
HERE is Edward Bear, coming
downstairs now, bump, bump, bump, on the back
of his head, behind Christopher Robin. It is, as far
as he knows, the only way of coming downstairs,
but sometimes he feels that there really is another
way, if only he could stop bumping for a moment
and think of it. And then he feels that perhaps there
isn't. Anyhow, here he is at the bottom, and ready
to be introduced to you. Winnie-the-Pooh.
When I first heard his name, I said, just as you
are going to say, ""But I thought he was a boy?""
""So did I,"" said Christopher Robin.
""Then you can't call him Winnie?""
""I don't.""
""But you said--""
""He's Winnie-ther-Pooh. Don't you know what
'ther' means?”

One day when he was out walking, he came to
an open place in the middle of the forest, and in the
middle of this place was a large oak-tree, and, from
the top of the tree, there came a loud buzzing-noise.

downstairs now, bump, bump, bump, on the back

but sometimes he feels that there really is another
way, if only he could stop bumping for a moment

isn't. Anyhow, here he is at the bottom, and ready

""I suppose I could,"" I said. ""What sort of stories

of his head, behind Christopher Robin. It is, as far

put his head between his paws and began to think.
